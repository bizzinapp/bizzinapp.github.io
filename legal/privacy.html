	  <h1 class="centered">Privacy Policy</h1>
	  <p class="centered">
		<span class="effectiveDate">Effective as of February 7, 2017</span>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to the Bizzin’ mobile application (the “App”) and the website located at http://www.bizzinapp.com, its subdomains, and all subpages (collectively the “Site”), which are owned and operated by Bizzin’ LLC (“Bizzin’ LLC”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), a Massachusetts limited liability company. We have created this Privacy Policy to tell you what information we collect on the Site and in the App, how we use that information, and who we will share that information with, if at all. This Privacy Policy does not address the privacy practices of any third parties that we do not own or control, but with whom we may otherwise be affiliated.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		We generally believe that your Application Data is not our business and do not intend to profit from it. At the same time, it is impossible not to collect at least some information about you to serve you properly. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy and to use the information it contains to learn about the data we do collect and to help you make informed decisions around how we handle your data.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Privacy is very important to us and is baked into the App. The Application Data you enter into the App never leave the device without your knowledge and are not stored by us on our servers. You may choose to back it up using iTunes, iCloud, or some other service, but we have no control over or access to the data. You have complete control over it. Be sure to back it up in Apple Inc.’s iTunes or through a service like iCloud! It is also possible to export the data in an unencrypted comma-separated .csv file.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		By visiting our Site or using our App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, the accompanying Terms of Use, and any third-party agreements that are incidental to our relationship, which for the App includes, without limitation, the Apple Inc. Licensed Application End User License Agreement and possibly the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions applicable to your jurisdiction that you agree to upon downloading, opening, and expanding available features of the App. You also recognize that our relationship is a commercial and not a consumer relationship. Terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use, if defined there, which you can find by visiting http://www.bizzinapp.com/legal/terms.html.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		While we have taken care to create cohesive and fair documents to govern our relationship, if any conflicts arise among them, Apple Inc.’s license and subscription agreement will take precedence over our Terms of Use, and our Terms of Use will take precedence over this Privacy Policy.
	  </p>

	  <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT OR RECEIVE</h2>
	  <p>While using the Site or operating the App, we will collect and receive the following types of information. You authorize us to collect and receive such information.</p>
	  <p>a.​<span class="inlineTitle">Personal Information.</span>We only receive or collect information that identifies you personally if you choose to provide such personally identifiable information to us via email or other means. When you sign up to become a user or contact us, you may be required to provide us with personal information about yourself (collectively, the “Personal Information”). Such Personal Information may include your name, e-mail address, physical address, and phone number. We do not collect any Personal Information from you when you use the App unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily.</p>
	  <p>b.<span class="inlineTitle">​Third-party Log In.</span>If at any point you sign in through our blog or through social media sites, which may use a third-party user-management system, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that the service-provider would provide to us through that service’s Application Programming Interface (“API”). Such information may include, without limitation, your first and last name, your service-provider username, your service-provider profile picture, headline, unique identifier and access token, and e-mail address.</p>
	  <p>c.<span class="inlineTitle">​Payment Information.</span>If you choose to make a purchase or subscribe to a feature or service of ours that requires a fee, you will be required to provide us, Apple Inc., or other third parties with your payment information, including, without limitation, bank account numbers, credit card or debit card numbers, account details, ACH information, and similar data (collectively, “Payment Information”). Such Payment Information will be collected and processed by third-party payment vendors pursuant to the terms and conditions of their privacy policies and terms of use, and we do not obtain access to any Payment Information in connection with such purchases or subscriptions.</p>
	  <p>d.<span class="inlineTitle">​Third-Party Analytics.</span>We and third-party technology providers working on our behalf may use third-party analytics services (Google Analytics, Facebook, and developers’ tools provided by Apple Inc. are examples) to improve the App and the Site to make them more relevant to our customers: e.g., to evaluate your use of the App or the Site, compile reports on activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to the App or the Site and mobile and Internet usage. We and these third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to help analyze and provide us the data. We try to collect this data anonymously and to use it only for our own purposes; however, sometimes different data is unavoidably connected in such a way that it can identify specific people, even without their names and contact information. You consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Please be advised that if you opt out of any such service (see, for example, Google’s opt-out page at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout), you may not be able to use the full functionality of the App or the Site.</p>
	  <p>e.<span class="inlineTitle">​External Data Imported Into the App.</span>The importing of contacts, photos, or any other data on your device is used only to copy the specific data you select into the App on your device alone. We will never access, store, or share any such Application Data from your device that you do not explicitly allow.</p>


	  <p>f.​<span class="inlineTitle">Other Information.</span>In addition to the Personal Information and Payment Information, we may automatically collect or receive additional information regarding you and your use of the App or the Site; your interactions with us; and information regarding your computer and mobile devices used to access the App or the Site (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include:</p>

		  <p class="indented">​E.​other commonly collected information.</p>
		  <p>iv.<span class="inlineTitle">​From Cookies.</span>We may use both session cookies, which expire once you close the App or the Site, and persistent cookies, which stay on your mobile device or computer until you delete them and other technologies to help us collect data and to enhance your experience with the App or the Site. Cookies are small text files a web browser or an app can use to recognize a repeat visitor. We may use cookies for various purposes, including to:</p>
		  <p class="indented">​A.​detect type of mobile device, computing system, or browser;</p>
		  <p class="indented">​B.​personalize your experience;</p>
		  <p class="indented">​C.​analyze which portions of the App or the Site are visited and used most frequently; and</p>
		  <p class="indented">​D.​measure and optimize our promotional effectiveness.</p>
		  <p>If you do not want us to deploy cookies on the Site or in the App, you can opt out by setting your browser or mobile device to reject cookies. You can still use the App or the Site if you choose to disable cookies, although your ability to use some of the features may be affected.</p>

	  <h2>4. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
	  <p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the databases of the third parties with which we may share such Information, nor can we guarantee that the Information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.

	  <h2>5. IMPORTANT NOTICES TO NON-U.S. RESIDENTS</h2>
	  <p>The Site and our servers are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that your Information, including your Personal Information, may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

	  <p>The Apple Inc. App Store may collect certain information in connection with your use of the App, such as Personal Information, Payment Information, Geolocational Information, and other usage-based data.
