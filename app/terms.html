      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us and supercedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether written, oral or electronic. No partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between you and us exists as a result of this Agreement.

    </p>

    <h3>Use of the App.</h3>
    <p>
      Use of the App does not include the provision of a mobile device or other necessary equipment to access it. To use the App you may require Internet connectivity and appropriate telecommunication links. We shall not have any responsibility or liability for any telephone or other costs you may incur.<br>
      <br>
      You shall not use the App in any way that (a) is in breach of any law, statute, regulation or bylaw of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) is fraudulent, criminal or unlawful; (c) may be obscene, indecent, pornographic, vulgar, profane, racist, sexist, discriminatory, offensive, derogatory, harmful, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, malicious, abusive, hateful, menacing, defamatory, untrue or political; (d) impersonates any other person or body or misrepresents a relationship with any person or body; (e) may infringe or breach the copyright or any intellectual property rights (including without limitation copyright, trademark rights and broadcasting rights) or privacy or other rights of us or any third party; (f) may be contrary to our interests; (g) is contrary to any specific rule or requirement that we stipulate on the App in relation to a particular part of the App or the App generally; or (h) involves your use, delivery or transmission of any viruses, unsolicited emails, trojan horses, trap doors, back doors, easter eggs, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Accurate Information.</h3>
    In order for you to access certain areas of or to use certain services within the app you may be required to provide information. Should you choose to access such areas or use such services, you agree to provide accurate, truthful and complete information, and to refrain from making any misrepresentations or impersonating any person or entity when providing such information.


    <h3>Fees and Refund Policy.</h3>
    Bizzin’ is free to download and install and can be used to track a limited number of clients (the “free client limit”) for free. The ability to track an unlimited number of clients (the “Unlimited Clients subscription”) in Bizzin’ is available via a monthly, auto-renewing subscription for sale in the App.<br>
    <br>
    The Unlimited Clients subscription includes a 30 day free trial period.  You may cancel your subscription at any time during the trial period to avoid charges.  At the end of the free trial you will be charged the subscription fee on an auto-renewing monthly basis.  You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun.<br>
    <br>
    You may cancel the subscription at any time. Canceling a subscription causes it to not renew and the subscription may remain active until the end of the current subscription period.  Any fees charged and collected for the current month will not be prorated or refunded.<br>
    <br>
    Paid Subscriptions and Free Trials are made available through the Apple App Store and are governed by the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions available at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/">http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/</a><br>

    <h3>Termination.</h3>
    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend your subscription and bar access to functionality in the app immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement.<br>
      <br>
      If you wish to terminate your subscription, you may do so anytime using the subscription management functionality provided by Apple.<br>
      <br>
      Upon termination of the subscription the App will prohibit data entry and may limit other functionality until the number of clients in the App is reduced below the free client limit.<br>
      <br>
      All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.<br>
