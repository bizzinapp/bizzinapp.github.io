  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p id="subheading">
    <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Effective Date: December 14, 2016</span><br>
    <br>
    This privacy policy was written to help you understand how the Bizzin' app stores and uses your data.  The policy applies only to the Bizzin' app and does not apply to the www.bizzinapp.com website.  Our goal is transparency and we want this policy to be clear and easy to understand.  If you feel there is information missing or have any questions or comments please <a href="mailto:support@bizzinapp.com?subject=Privacy Policy">let us know</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Your data is literally none of our business.</h2>
  <p>
    Privacy is very important to us and is baked into Bizzin'.  The data entered into Bizzin' never leaves the device without your knowledge.  You have complete control over your data and we are unable to access it outside of the Bizzin' app.  Your data is not stored by us on any servers and we believe that we do not need and should not have access to it.  We do not intend to ever make money by selling your data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please read on for details on how we handle your data and to learn about the data we do collect.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>i. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
    <p>
      In order to provide some of our services (i.e. support requests, accept user feedback, mailing lists) we may store personally identifiable information that you share with us (i.e. email address, name).
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h4>How do we use your PII?</h4>
      <p>
        We make every reasonable effort to safeguard your PII.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we only use your PII for purposes directly related to the reason you share it with us.  For example, if you contact support we may store your email address only for the purposes of replying to your support request.  We would not use that email address for other purposes without your explicit consent.
      </p>
      <h4>Do we share your PII with any third parties?</h4>
      <p>
        We may share your PII with trusted third parties for the purpose of operating our services.  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please contact us for a current list of third party service providers we use and links to their privacy policies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>ii. Usage Metadata</h3>
    <p>
      In our constant effort to provide the best possible service we collect and analyze anonymized data about how Bizzin' is being used.  We will refer to this as "Usage Metadata".
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h4>What is Usage Metadata?</h4>
      <p>
        Usage Metadata is data that describes your Application Data (defined below) but does not contain your Application Data.  In other words, it describes what was done with the app without the details.  For example, if you create a client and input a name and email our usage metadata would reflect that a client was created with a name and email but we would not know the actual name or email address of your client.
      </p>
      <h4>What is included in Usage Metadata?</h4>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">No personally identifiable information is included in Usage Metadata.</span>  In fact, we do not collect any of the data you enter into Bizzin'.  A random identifier generated with your installation of Bizzin' is associated with your Usage Metadata.  We may collect information about your device (screen size, iOS version, language, etc) but we do not collect any unique identifiers for your device nor do we collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.
      </p>

      <h4>Why do we collect Usage Metadata?</h4>
      <p>
          Collecting and analyzing Usage Metadata is crucial to our ongoing efforts to improve Bizzin'.  We analyze Usage Metadata to identify features that are missing, identify features in need of improvement, and make sure that when we do make changes that they are for the best.  Everything we do with Usage Metadata is directly related to improving Bizzin'.  We will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> use it for anything else.

      <h4>How do we collect Usage Metadata?</h4>
      <p>
        Usage Metadata is periodically sent to trusted third party service providers.  Analysis of the data is done by our team but we use tools provided by third parties to help us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please contact us for a current list of third party service providers we use and links to their privacy policies.
      </p>

  </div>

  <h2>3. Data We Don't Collect</h2>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>i. Application Data</h3>
    <p>
      While using our service you will enter data into the Bizzin' app.  We will refer to this data as "Application Data".
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h4>Where is Application Data stored?</h4>
      <p>
        Application Data is stored on your device.  We have no access to your Application Data outside of the Bizzin' app.  We do not store your Application Data on any servers and we do not send your Application Data to any third parties.
      </p>

      <h4>Is Application Data encrypted?</h4>
      <p>
        If you have a passcode enabled your Application Data is encrypted by iOS whenever the device is locked.
      </p>


      <h4>Application Data Backup/Export</h4>
      <p>
        Application Data leaves your device when you backup or export and it is important to safeguard this data.
      </p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h5>iCloud Backups</h5>
        <p>
          Application Data backed up to iCloud is securely handled by iCloud and there is no additional effort needed on your part to keep it safe.  Details are available <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303">from apple</a>.
        </p>
        <h5>iTunes Backups</h5>
        <p>
          It is your responsibility to safeguard Application Data backed up to your computer using iTunes.  It is strongly encouraged that you create encrypted iTunes backups (this is supported by iTunes).
        </p>
        <h5>Exported Application Data</h5>
        <p>
          Application Data exported from Bizzin' is exported unencrypted in csv format.  It is your responsibility to safeguard this exported data.  Note that email or other services you use to send your exported data from the app may end up with a copy and it is a good idea to read and understand their privacy policies to know how they will handle your data.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>ii. Contacts, Photos, and other Device Data</h3>
    <p>
      Access to contacts, photos, or any other data on your device is used only to copy the specific data you select into the Bizzin' app.  We will never access, store, or share any data from your device that you do not explicitly allow.</p>
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>4. Data You Share</h2>
  <p>
    Some of Bizzin's features enable you to send data out of the app.  For example, you can email a receipt to one of your clients.  When you send data outside of Bizzin' you should be aware that the services you use to share that data may retain a copy of it.  In our receipt example, your email service provider would likely end up storing a copy of the receipt email and attachment on their servers.  It is prudent that you look into the privacy policies of those services if you would like to understand how they handle your data.
  </p>
  <h2>5. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    As our service evolves we may change this policy from time to time and we will post any changes on this page. By continuing to use Bizzin' after those changes are in effect you agree to the revised policy. If there are significant changes to this policy we may provide more prominent notice or get your consent as required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By using Bizzin' you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact us</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions regarding privacy while using Bizzin', or have questions about our practices, please <a href="support@bizzinapp.com">contact us</a>.
